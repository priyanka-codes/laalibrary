# LAA Library
This project is supposed to contain all possible library functions related to linear algebra.

Those contributing to this repository must keep the following things in mind:
- Any changes made to the class constructors, data members, member functions, utility functions, function prototypes/definitions are accepted however these must be documented.
- All programming must be done using the object-oriented paradigm
- All functions must have basic error/exception handling
- Known limitations of methods(functions) must be documented
- Contributors must refrain from using standard library functions of these operations or related to the operation as the aim of the project is to create a library for these operations.
